# House-Price-Prediction
 Overview  (this beginner-level project) 

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical housing data, it aims to provide accurate price estimations based on various features like bedrooms , bathroom , area in sqft and etc . 

Dataset - From https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
Objectives
- Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices
- Analyze influential features affecting real estate prices
- Utilize data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Compare different regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model

Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, joblib) 
- Jupyter Notebook for development
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest )
